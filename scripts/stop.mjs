// Stop every running Agent Anywhere instance (daemon + agent subprocesses), whichever way it was started.
//
// Why this exists: the daemon is a long-lived process, and it is easy to end up with MORE THAN ONE
// instance running at once (e.g. a `dist` daemon left over from before a rebuild, plus a fresh `tsx
// watch` one). Multiple instances share the same IM bot token and RACE to handle each message, which
// produces baffling "sometimes new behaviour, sometimes old" symptoms. This script force-kills them all
// so you can start exactly one clean instance. It also sweeps up orphaned `claude-agent-acp` children
// that a killed daemon may have left behind.
//
// Matched, on purpose, narrowly enough to never hit your editor / Claude Code / unrelated node procs:
//   - Agent Anywhere daemon started from dist:  node .../dist/cli.js start
//   - Agent Anywhere daemon started from src:   tsx ... src/cli.ts start  (dev:watch)
//   - agent subprocesses:               claude-agent-acp

const rows = sh('ps -Ao pid,command').split('\n');
// The `start` subcommand may be separated from the entry file by global flags
// (`node dist/cli.js --config foo.yaml start`), and the entry may be a relative
// path — so: entry file anywhere in the line, `start` anywhere after it.
// Anchor the first token after the pid to node/tsx: a shell line that merely
// QUOTES such a command (`zsh -c "…; node dist/cli.js start"`) must not match,
// or this script kills the wrapping shell.
